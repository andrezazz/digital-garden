# Hello! This is the repo that runs my digital garden.

## You can visit the garden itself at [blog.charlietrochlil.com](https://blog.charlietrochlil.com).

It is built from a lovely template made by [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt) with a little bit of tweaking here and there.

If you'd like to build your own digital garden like it, Max [has a great tutorial, too](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
