I had a conversation with a friend recently about my relationship to art as I came into college and my relationship to entrepreneurship as I leave it. I realized in both cases, while I didn't want to pursue either thing full-time, it was still important that I be surrounded by the kinds of people who had an interest in it. And it made me realize that the creative impulse for artists and for entrepreneurs is pretty similar, and I'm always looking to be plugged into a community with that kind of creative impulse.

I realized pretty quickly writing about [[Scenes]] in general was going to have to be its own post, so if you want more on that, check it out.

In general, scenes for artists and for entrepreneurs (mostly of the tech variety) are highly similar. You've got a bunch (or maybe a few) really passionate people all hanging out and swapping ideas. Their goal isn't to make something incredible or earth-shattering, just to have fun with their craft and have a good time building together. It's only once people outside the scene start looking in that the rest of the world realizes *wow, they've been crafting some really brilliant shit over here.*
