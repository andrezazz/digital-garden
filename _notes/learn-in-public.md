title: Learning in Public
---
When I had my first decent internship last summer, I was amazed at how quickly and effectively I picked up the tech skills (mostly SQL) that I needed. I had gotten a shaky introduction the topic the semester before, but at the internship, I blew past my previous skill level. It felt great to learn and to use what I was learning.

Fast forward to the following semester of school, and I'm bored out of my gourd, retaining nothing, feeling like I'm wasting my time. COVID-mandated online classes and Senioritis aside, why did this suck so much? Why wasn't I learning as much or having as much fun as I had at my internship?

Academic learning doesn't have the same feedback loops as on-the-job learning, which kills motivation and makes it possible to waste way more time on things that don't end up being important. When you're learning alongside others in order to accomplish something it gives you:

-clear prioritization for the things you're learning
-frequent gauges of your progress
-a support network that understands your needs
-tons of positive reinforcement when you're on-track

It feels good to learn like this. Really good. When I decided that I wanted to start building some static sites, the very first thing I did was call a friend for whom I knew I could build something. I knew that having a project would motivate me much more than just following an online course, plus then I'd only learn things as they became relevant to me.

This blog (and the concept of [[Digital Gardens]] in general) takes advantage of that momentum, motivation, and feedback that comes with learning things in a visible space.

### Some great readings on this idea:
**swyx.io** is probably the king of #LearninPublic so I'd be remiss not to [link his article](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) (and you'd be remiss not to read it)<br>
**Andy Matuschak** has a nice writeup about doing your work ["with the garage door up"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up) that illustrates the concept through a beautiful metaphor connecting [[Business/Art Parallels|tech folks with artists and craftspeople.]]
