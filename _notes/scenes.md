title: Scenes and Scenius
---

I think it's pretty hard to overstate the importance of a good scene. What's a scene? One of my favorite definitions comes from [@visakanv on twitter](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1153706486586994688):

> ### any small group of people loosely-but-truly aligned on something ... producing public-facing work that's directed at each other

Some things in that definition that initially surprised me:
- loose alignment
- public-facing
- directed at each other

We'll return to those in a moment. To further build out this definition, I want to introduce the concept of...

## Scenius

Brian Eno coined the term [Scenius](https://medium.com/salvo-faraday/what-is-the-scenius-15409eb6ac72) to talk about the brilliance that can come out of a group of people that are working alongside one another creatively. (Seems appropriate coming from somebody whose "associated acts" on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno) looks like it does.)

Eno offers the concept of scenius as a response to the myth of the Great Man, saying that as an art student he believed that certain painters were just transcendently brilliant, and that's why we know their names today. However, given a little bit of research, you find that most of the 'greats' were in constant conversation with lots of other artists and creatives, and this propelled them forward.

Eno posits that scenius is the "intelligence of a whole." Rather than individuals being brilliant in their own right, their brilliance is [[synergy|synergistic]] with the minds around them.

### Eno (or perhaps a blog quoting him, it's unclear) gives some factors crucial to the "geography of scenius":
- **Mutual appreciation** -- the simultaneous uplifting and goading on of friendly competition and supportive exploration
- **Rapid exchange of tools and techniques** -- creatives within a scene constantly borrowing and building on one another's good ideas
- **Network effects of success** -- one person's success is the success of the scene, which elevates everyone and pushes the work forward
- **Tolerance for the novelties** -- space is afforded for mavericks and renegades so that local [[wet blanket regimes]] won't harsh their (weird, transgressive, innovative) vibe
	- This one is not quite the same as [[psychological safety]] because it's more about safety from judgment from outside the group, but it's definitely similar, and I might posit psych safety as the fifth point, if I were to add one.

### In no particular order, some scenes that seem noteworthy:
- Silicon Valley, for tech startups
- every tavern the Founding Fathers hung out in
- Greenwich Village for the beat poets
