title: The Laws of Content

A couple of ways the internet incentivizes making **lots** of mediocre and/or dishonest garbage.

### Too Much Content

Space on the internet is free, with nobody to gate-keep what you can or can't post. So 

### Dishonest Content

There's lots of clear examples of dishonesty online. Clickbait YouTube titles. Blog posts that are 'recycled' from elsewhere on the web. Basically anything that occurs on Instagram. We've become so used to the fact that people lie online that we've developed memes specifically to respond to stories we think are fake.

What's the difference between dishonesty and [[faking it]]?

### Clicks are a Terrible Measure of Worth

In the attention economy, all of these practices make business sense. Dishonesty gets you more clicks per post, putting out constant drivel creates more aggregate clicks. The problem is that this creates an internet that looks like a never-ending tabloid rack in the grocery store checkout line. Shocking headlines about people you don't care about, personalities famous for their own fame, nothing that would make you think too hard. *Just click.*

### Sources, resources, links

A lot of what gets made ends up being [[ambient content]].

There'd be less fake nonsense if folks were more comfortable [[sucking at stuff]].
