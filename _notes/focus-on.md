# Especially when it doesn't matter

This post is inspired in part by a great tweet from [deepfates](https://deepfates.com):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">cognitive security 101: <br><br> you have to find something to obsess over. <br> do not let this choice be made for you</p>&mdash; invisible college dropout (@deepfates) <a href="https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1347384988279336960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is one out of many reasons that it'd be awfully nice to [[unplug]] from so many forms of the web I currently consume. Naturally, there's lots of reasons that is also very difficult to do.

The other part of inspiration for this came from [Chase McCoy's notes](https://chasem.co/notes/principles) about paying attention to where your attention lives

[This blog post](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/the-good-room/) is pretty remarkable: examines the intentionality of place and how Amish culture is just a more intentional boundary-setting

Big surprise, this is yet another form of your [[relationships]] to the different elements of your life
