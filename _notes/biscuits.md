## Attempt Log

### Batch 3 - 1.18.21
- not as much rise, butter had melted a bit
- need to cut frozen butter before added to the bowl
- might experiment next time with chilling dough before baking

### Batch 2 - 1.?.21
- grated the butter, effective but very messy
- good rise
- didn't have honey, definitely noticeable flavor change

### Batch 1 - 1.9.21
- cut biscuits too small, inside was dry
- struggled getting butter to right size with hands
- not much rise
