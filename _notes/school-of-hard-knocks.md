title: School of Hard Knocks

I started writing this on Bean Dad Day to unpack and examine some of my thoughts around learning from failure.

## Bean Dad

I won't unpack the whole situation, but the obvious issues I see with the Bean Dad Saga is:
- no helpful [[criticism]] from Bean Dad, just weird vague taunts
- even fun learning sucks when you're hungry, unfun learning becomes torturous
- what a self-important jerk

## The real meat of it

Maybe there isn't enough of a meaningful difference between this note and my note on [[sucking]] but the short and long is that I do think failing at things is necessary. Every answer should not be given to you at the outset. You should not receive an A on every assignment. Things should be hard and painful sometimes because being a human person in the world is hard and painful sometimes.
