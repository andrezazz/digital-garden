title: Faking It
---



In high school, I met one of my best friends and learned that he was a very talented guitarist. I'd wanted to start a band for some time, so I told him that I played the bass and we should jam sometime.

I did not play the bass. I had very basic picking skills from learning classical guitar in middle school, but I was at best rusty, at worst, a total novice. I spent about three weeks practicing daily and learning new songs, hoping that when my friend and I met to play together, I wouldn't embarrass myself.

We spent the next 3 years making music together. I joked for some time that I had tricked him into forming a band with me, and he admitted that he felt for a long time that I was overestimating his skills. So, what was the reality?

Eventually, faking it leads you to the conclusion that you are, in fact, capable of something.
