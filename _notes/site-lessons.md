title: Lessons from Building this Site
---
In the interest of doing some [[learn-in-public|learning in public]] I've decided to log all of the lessons that creating and maintaining this jekyll blog teaches me.

Once again, a truly massive thanks to [Maxime Vaillaincourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) for use of his [open source temlate](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) that I'm using.

## Hard-learned lessons

-Keep careful track of your files. Especially if there's a different between `_pages` and `_notes` and you're trying to make changes show up in a particular file that you've accidentally duplicated into both of them.

-Similar to the above: if you need a particular filetype on your new posts in order for them to be read, make sure you use it!

-In markdown, the titles of pages need to come after a space, otherwise it'll break the whole site push.
