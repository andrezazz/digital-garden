## Adam Grant's Guidelines to Authenticity

### 1. Authenticity without boundaries is careless

- lawyers who were 'themselves' in an interview only did better if their resumes were already highly ranked

### 2. Authenticity without empathy is selfish

- being 'honest' does not need to equal being blunt

### 3. Authenticity witout status & trust is risky

- as you prove your value, you accrue more *idiosyncrasy credit* which, from wikipedia is "an individual's capacity to acceptably deviate from group expectations"
	- reminiscent of "tolerance for the novelties" in [[scenes]], except that tolerance is inherent, not earned
