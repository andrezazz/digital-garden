title: Humanuals/READMEs/Self-Story
status: growing

Something I'm thinking about. Off-the-bat ideas:

- self-story is context dependent which is why I struggled to write my [[cbt|personal page]] on here.
- much like the things you [[focus on]] shaping your mental life, self-story shapes your reality
- your self-story is also a sort of [[word magic]], where you tell it to others and they see it in you

Apparently the title for this page is a [Delphic Maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphic_maxims), which I did not know.
