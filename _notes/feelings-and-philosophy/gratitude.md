Don't have a snappy intro for this one. I'm not some kind of guru or pop psychologist, but I do think gratitude is on the whole, real good for you. Here's some thoughts about why.

## Gratitude is a Mood Booster

There's an excellent [thread](https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1361390835426856960?s=20) from Nick Cammarata about this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my happiest friends are all impressed by everything all the time</p>&mdash; Nick Cammarata (@nickcammarata) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1361390835426856960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think the reason is that being impressed is a combination of being perceptive in the moment -- literally the senses &quot;impressing&quot; into you -- and gratitude, two keys to life satisfaction</p>&mdash; Nick Cammarata (@nickcammarata) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1361393377363820544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Gratitude is Infectious
