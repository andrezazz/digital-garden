Brian Eno yet again is the author of a fantastic concept (his other I like is [[scenes|scenius]]).

The 'long now' is a conception of the present that understands that it "grows out of the past and is a seed for the future."

In a bizarre colliding of worlds, Eno points out that most of our plans and actions are focused on a very shortly-arriving future, which puts him in conversation with Peter Thiel's concept of [[indefinite optimism]]. From Eno's article:

> "Our astonishing success as a technical civilization has led us to complacency, to expect that things will probably just keep getting better."

Eno considers the Long Now a sort of empathy that extends to future generations.
