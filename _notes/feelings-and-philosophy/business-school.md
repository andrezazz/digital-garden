My undergrad education was in business (or 'Commerce' as it was termed at my school) and it seems like an oversight to avoid writing about it. I figure this page will become more and more in-depth and thoughtful as I create greater distance between myself and the experience and determine what was valuable and what... wasn't.

## Some topics from biz school
- [[psychological safety]]
- [[synergy]]
- an affinity for [[frameworks]]
- [[Goodhart's Law]]
