Ego depletion is a concept from [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557) that I think is very broadly written about in other contexts and useful in general.

## Definition

Across different studies and experiments, behavioral economists (like psychology but fancy) found that there's a connection between tasks that are:

- intellectually challenging
- physically taxing
- reliant on willpower

Namely, that all three types of activities will interfere with one another when performed in tandem or in sequence. This would point towards the existence of a shared pool of energy that all of these types of activities draw on. (It might be glucose in the brain but that's not fully confirmed.)

## Other examples

David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) methodology is based around a concept of **psychic ram**: that things you're thinking about but haven't adequately captured are a drain on your mental resources and cause you to be less efficient overall.
