It feels like a cliché to say something like "life is for living," but sometimes things become clichés... because they are true.

## Optimization

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can&#39;t LIVE a project, only in the CONTEXT of particular project, at a particular time, LIFE, THE HORIZON, is the only thing that affords LIVING.</p>&mdash; Rival Voices (@nosilverv) <a href="https://twitter.com/nosilverv/status/1379355999648223234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

These tweets are near the end of an [excellent thread](https://twitter.com/nosilverv/status/1379355975556210692?s=20) on why 'optimizing' your life flattens it and strips its meaning.

## Business Metaphors in Life

Some things that get talked about:

- ["Personal Brand"](https://youtu.be/rPHK494AUxE)

- [The Minimum Viable Good Life](https://www.nickdewilde.com/the-minimum-viable-good-life/) (I actually like this article overall, but it does fit the broader trend.)

- [Personal CRMs](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/11/personal-crm-software-uphabit-dex-google-spreadsheets/601531/)

This is the reason that [[hustle]] culture feels so dismal to me, it transforms the entirety of your life into a business pursuit.
