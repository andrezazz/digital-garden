I read Peter Thiel's book Zero to One recently. (It was for a class and I probably wouldn't have bought the book otherwise.) In it, he posits that there's a [[framework]] for understanding how people and societies view the future:

A definite view of the future is that you control it and determine time's course. An indefinite view of the future holds that things will occur and you cannot know what they'll be.

Optimism and pessimism are somewhat self explanatory.

While I'm not convinced by many of Thiel's arguments and conclusions based on this framework, it is an interesting way to understand our relationship to what has yet to happen.
