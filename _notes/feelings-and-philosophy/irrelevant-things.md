I think titling this note "be curious" would be too vague, but I do think it's basically what the conversation is about.

Being interested in things that don't have an immediate need or benefit for you is important and enriching. It makes you a [[cool people|cooler and more interesting person]]. It gives you more to talk and think about, which naturally leads to more learning and discovery.

### Irrelevant is a misnomer

The trick about knowing irrelevant things is that they often wind up being valuable in unexpected ways. Sometimes it's as a metaphor, allowing you to think or talk about things in a different way. Often it's context that becomes transferrable to very different subjects.
