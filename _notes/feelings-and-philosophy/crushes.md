## Spotting Crushes in the Wild

Most of the sources online agree on **butterflies** being the tell-tale symptom of crushing, a result of the adrenaline in your system when you think about your crush.

I would identify how intently you [[focus on]] a person as another powerful indicator of a crush. When you've got a crush on somebody (or on a place, or an idea), you dedicate substantial attention to that crush, whether or not you consciously choose to. As timescanner says:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“HAVING A CRUSH” is a form of CURIOSITY that is often mistaken for LOVE</p>&mdash; T I M E D E S T R O Y E R (@timescanner) <a href="https://twitter.com/timescanner/status/1358834889815068672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I think this understanding aligns better with the idea of 'crushing' as something that you can do in a romantic context, but that might also apply to people with whom you don't have romantic/sexual intentions. Which brings us briefly to:

### The (Nonexhaustive) Taxonomy of Crushes

- Romantic crush: the most common form of crush, a parasocial relationship to a person you find attractive
- Friend crush: like a crush, but platonic. A strong interest in becoming friends with somebody that you may or may not act on
- Art crush: for creatives, having a fascination/infatuation with another creative's work, wanting to know them *or* their work better
- Fascinations: Falling down rabbit holes of particular topics, areas, or hobbies. (Perhaps not a crush per se, but certainly a relative of it.)

## A broad definition of 'crush'

The excitement and attention that romantic crushes produce is not unique to romantic attraction, so I propose that we understand 'crush' as an umbrella term. Lots of things can be a [[fun]] fascination/obsession/infatuation, not just people that we're hypothetically, romantically interested in.

## What's the function of a crush?

Whether our fascination is with a potential person, a hopeful new friend, or an exciting idea, crushes tend to become a sort of **mental screensaver**. When you're not actively thinking about anything else, your attention drifts towards the thing or person you're crushing on. To borrow an idea from Paul Graham, a crush is almost always the [top idea in your mind](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html), which means it'll drift to you when you're in the shower or doing your dishes.
