status: growing
---

Negative capability was a concept posited by John Keats, that writers, thinkers, and creatives are

> “capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.”

This idea lines up with a favorite and well-quoted line from Walt Whitman:

> "Do I contradict myself?
> Very well then I contradict myself,
> (I contain multitudes)"
