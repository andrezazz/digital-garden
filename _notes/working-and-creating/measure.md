title: Measure → Manage
status: growing

There's a quote in business (apparently from Peter Drucker) that "what gets measured gets managed". The metrics a business decides to [[focus on]] will become the metrics that the business seeks to optimize, which leads into [[Goodhart's Law]] and ruins the metric.

But if we think about this concept in a personal context, in light of the [[transactional]], treat-your-life-like-a-business mindset, there's a similarly thorny outcome.

## Humans are Hard to Measure

Here's an excellent tweet from Adam Grant:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many people chase wealth, status, and achievement because progress is easy to measure, failing to realize that the gains that count the most are the hardest to count.<br><br>Real growth is building character—striving to improve in generosity, integrity, humility, fairness, or courage.</p>&mdash; Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1342832685950128128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
