## Attempt Log

### Batch 5 - 1.30.21
- cut biscuits in 2.75in squares, consistent shape was nice
- baked for about 15 minutes, great internal texture
- not as much rise as I would've liked

### Batch 4 - 1.21.21
- cut up the butter before mixing, big help
- great rise on this batch, butter definitely stayed colder
- little bit doughy/underbaked in the middle. Attributed to:
	- put dough in freezer for about 15 mins before baking
	- cut biscuits a lot bigger than usual

### Batch 3 - 1.18.21
- not as much rise, butter had melted a bit
- need to cut frozen butter before added to the bowl
- might experiment next time with chilling dough before baking

### Batch 2 - 1.?.21
- decreased the baking powder, improved flavor
- grated the butter, effective but very messy
- good rise
- didn't have honey, definitely noticeable flavor change

### Batch 1 - 1.9.21
- cut biscuits too small, inside was dry
- bit of a chemical flavor
- struggled getting butter to right size with hands
- not much rise
