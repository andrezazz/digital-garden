	- 2 cups flour
	- 2.5 tsp Baking Powder
	- .5 tsp salt
	- .5 tsp Cream of Tartar
3. Add .5 cup *cold, cut* butter, mix until pea-sized
4. Add .66 cup milk and 1 tbsp honey - mix until dough comes together
5. Knead dough several times
6. Flatten or roll dough to .5-.75 inches high
7. Cut dough to 2.5-inch squares
8. Bake around 12 minutes

## Attempt Log

### Batch 8 - 3.10.21
- dough started pretty dry again, might need to start doing flour by weight
- otherwise, good batch!

### Batch 7b - 2.25.21
- eyeballed the honey, which was a mistake
- dough way too wet, biscuits came out very flat and brown
- still tasted good tho

### Batch 7a - 2.25.21
- good batch!
- added about 1.5 extra Tbsp of milk to get the dough to bind

### Batch 6 - 2.8.21
- Good rise!
- Upped heat from 400 to 425, much better color on top and crust on bottom
- Used chilled rolling pin rather than hands to flatten dough
- Tried connecting some biscuits, did slightly increase rise but also led to underbaked insides

### Batch 5 - 1.30.21
- cut biscuits in 2.75in squares, consistent shape was nice
- baked for about 15 minutes, great internal texture
- not as much rise as I would've liked

### Batch 4 - 1.21.21
- cut up the butter before mixing, big help
- great rise on this batch, butter definitely stayed colder
- little bit doughy/underbaked in the middle. Attributed to:
	- put dough in freezer for about 15 mins before baking
	- cut biscuits a lot bigger than usual

### Batch 3 - 1.18.21
- not as much rise, butter had melted a bit
- need to cut frozen butter before added to the bowl
- might experiment next time with chilling dough before baking

### Batch 2 - 1.?.21
- decreased the baking powder, improved flavor
- grated the butter, effective but very messy
- good rise
- didn't have honey, definitely noticeable flavor change

### Batch 1 - 1.9.21
- cut biscuits too small, inside was dry
- bit of a chemical flavor
- struggled getting butter to right size with hands
- not much rise
