title: Tarot & Other Information Tech
status: seed

If we accept (and I very much do) Uel's premise on [[why tarot]] is useful: that it's a human-crafted piece of information technology that you can negotiate with to find meaning...

how can it interplay with other pieces of information technology?


## Tarot.lol
I made [a little site](https://www.tarot.lol) that pulls cards and gives a few meanings. It's very much a work in progress, so I figured I'd keep track here of some of the things I want to add to the site:

- [ ] customizable spread layout
- [ ] suggested card assignment on spreads
- [ ] annotated cards & hover-over meaning exploration
- [ ] transitional notes for cards
- [ ] scrape other tarot sites for meanings
- [ ] analysis on keyword-overlap on cards
- [ ] sentiment analysis on keywords to assign cards quantitative values
