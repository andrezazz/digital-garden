I don't believe in magic, but the longer I spend on this planet in this meat sack of a body, the more I want to trust there's some level of organizing force present. I don't know what that force is, and I'm not too invested in trying to figure it out.

Tarot, though, is a cool and interesting [[framework]] for examining life, and it's something that I'd like to get better at understanding, investigating, and applying.

### Tarot is associative

The thing I enjoy about tarot more than astrology or Myers-Briggs or other forms of nonsense magic is that it morphs given context. Cards have an array of meanings, and their meanings change as they interact with each other.

> I know that the astrology afficionados will yell at me that it is also context-dependent because of like, multiple planets and the way they move and stuff. But my birthday stays the same at all times, so shush.

Much like a [[digital garden]] and our brains, Tarot is built on connections between meanings. I think that's a pretty neat way to look at things, and reading the cards is a helpful way for me to consider things in my life from novel angles. To better learn the system, I'm making it [[learning in public]].

I love the [Compound Eye Substack](https://compoundeye.substack.com/).

[Jessica Dore](https://www.jessicadore.com/) is also very insightful on twitter and in her newsletter.

The [labyrinthos](https://labyrinthos.co/) app is really handy for learning and quizzing. I should make a better habit of using it.

Uel recommended T Susan Chang's Tarot Correspondences as a "book that's more than 50% spreadsheets, just the alignment of cards with other systems"
