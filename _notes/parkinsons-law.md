I talk about this all the time but frequently forget the name for it, so I'm making a note.

**Parkinson's Law** states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion.

I've just found that generally to be true, and it certainly factors into discussions about creating boundaries and being in control of the things you [[focus on]].
