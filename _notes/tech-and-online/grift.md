This note is about how everybody needing a #hustle makes being online (and alive) a total bummer-fest. I'll do my best not to rag on capitalism in general.

# What is a grift?

Wikipedia has a [fun article on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick) but a grifter is just a synonym for a con-man. Which is itself short for 'confidence man'. Con artists are people who trick people (their 'marks') for profit. Most of what I'm going to talk about on this note is not *technically* a con, but it feels like the people who buy into it are being swindled in some capacity.

### "Innovation"

There's a space wherein actual *fraud* happens, [Theranos](https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-founder-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-life-story-bio-2018-4)-style, but I think there's a much larger and more subtle space where things aren't fraudulent but feel like a scam, [Juicero](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down)-style. In both cases, the marks were big investors in silicon valley so hyped up on *new and innovative* that there isn't any common-sense heuristic involved.

### "Teaching"

Many online courses are, at face value, a little absurd. I'm not talking about Udemy or Coursera or what have you. I mean the dudes (they're usually male, aren't they?) who are constantly serving you ads from their lambo, trying to convince you to buy their course on:

- drop-shipping
- NOT drop-shipping
- the stock market
- crypto currency

To which I must always say to my phone

> "If you got so crazy rich doing X, why do you need the extra money from teaching a course about X?"

A great tweet on this phenomenon:

The crazy thing is, whether or not these guys are literally a part of a pyramind scheme, they end up using roughly the same tactics. Most of the startups I've seen that are "education"-oriented are the same way: trying to sell you some notion of success that's wholly unbelievable because, well, if the person peddling it was that successful, why is their best option right now teaching this class?

### Grifting is Liberation

Three things that seem to unite most grifters:

1. Their contempt for Corporate Lifeâ„¢ and all its trappings
2. Their desire to make good money
3. Their love of their [[hustle]]

These are all super compelling selling points, with the slightly thorny parenthetical of: most grifts (the pyramidal ones) will create freedom and prosperity for the person pulling the grift, but none for you, their unsuspecting mark.

### A better way is possible

It's not impossible to be earnestly interested in learning and in teaching people.

### Admitting my cynicism

The thing about most of the grifts I'm referring to is that they aren't *actually* scams in a definitional sense. They're the equivalent of a dude aggressively selling you his mixtape on the street. Perfectly legal, but feels a little scummy and makes you seriously question whether there's actually been any value added to your life, and by extension, the world.
