title: Longevity in Online Content

Things on the web are super ephemeral, which is a major bummer, since one of the cool things about digital artifacts is how durable they should be. One of the reasons I was interested in [[digital gardens]] was that the idea of having a place to *capture* the things I read and think about was kind of revolutionary. I'm somewhat mournful of the fact that I only started gardening in my last year at university, because I'm sure a lot of interesting content could've been captured from the previous three years.

Longevity is a great reason to [[make things from scratch]], since you aren't reliant on another platform/host/etc.
