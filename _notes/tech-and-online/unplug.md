The woman who babysat me when I was 2 was 73 at the time. She's 93 now. She's never owned a computer, and I kind of envy her for it. Writing her letters every few weeks is one of the most intentional, mindful practices I have. I started this blog in large part because I'm unhappy with how I exist on the internet. So how do I get better at it? How do we all get better at it?

## A tool should not ask things of you

My [[relationships|relationship]] with my phone isn't what it should be. It exists for my benefit. It shouldn't ever feel like a burden in my pocket, like something that *requires* things of me. As Maxime points out [in his blog on the topic](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/turning-my-smartphone-into-a-boring-tool) a phone should be a tool, and tools are boring. Nobody ever got addicted to a hammer, or a blender, or even an airfryer (although people certainly get excited about them).

## Things that happen online are boring

Due in large part to the [[laws of content]] most of what gets put onto the internet is really uninteresting. Anne Li [identified her own issues](https://anli.io/portfolio/escaping-web) with social media as being rooted mostly in the content: she wasn't seeing much of what she was interested in, but got a **lot** of time-wasting garbage. My friends that use Tiktok have especially noted this as a feature of the app: you see **lots** of videos that aren't really that good/interesting/what-have-you, but every once in a while you get a really good one, so you stay scrolling, hoping for more finds.

I think I need a new note to talk about my [[grievances with Online]] because they are becoming more multitudinous on this blog.
