title: Grievances with Online™

I complain a lot about the internet. I think it's much the same way that a person complains about their crappy apartment, or the big faceless company they work for. There's something so soul-crushing and mundane about this place we've all learned to exist. I needed this note as a linker for a lot of the things I was realizing were connected. So here we go.

# The list of things about the internet I do not like

(The disclaimer on all of this is that I believe fervently in the ability of the internet to generate real good for people. But I think the systems in place are mostly not conducive to that. Disclaimer over.)

### The [[Laws of Content]] ruin creativity

We could be making and consuming so much cool stuff online! Instead, there are 1,000 reaction videos and meta-drama about meta-drama. I know this is the gripe that makes me sound the most like a crotchety old man, but I can't get over how banal things are.

### So many things that could be cool become [[grifts]] instead

Not that grifting couldn't happen in the real world, but it feels like so many of the things about the internet that have *exciting potential* like forming cool communities or creating opportunities to learn have instead become a #EntrepreneurMoment for tech and/or finance bros to exploit.

### Everything is engineered to be addictive so you never [[unplug]]

This is pretty well-documented so I don't feel the need to defend this claim too hard. I just think it's uncool.

### The lack of [[longevity in online content]]

The feed goes by too quickly. I'm tired of losing things that I think are cool.

### The dearth of [[Good Content™]]

Since there isn't a lot incentivizing good things being made, good things often don't get made. When they do, they can still have a hard time finding the limelight.

### The Tech overlords don't care if you're [[tech literate]]

You might argue that a lot of them want you to be less aware of how things work, where your data goes, etc.

### Why are there so many [[ads online]]?

I know the answer to this one, but it does still bum me out.
