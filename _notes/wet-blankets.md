It feels like a lot of people and institutions exist exclusively to be a huge bummer whenever possible. I've encountered plenty of them, and I'm sure that's not going to change anytime soon. So I'm going to do what any good scientist would: document it.

### Requirement-Meeters

This was super duper common in undergrad [[business school]]. A req-meeter's prime directive is to do **precisely** the amount of work necessary to meet the brief. They'll squash any attempts to have fun with a project or get creative with an assignment. Their motivations are self-serving, but not hard to understand. They don't want anybody creating more effort or risk for them. Fun things are often effortful or risky. 

### Imagination-Disbelievers

This is a hybrid of cynicism and control-issues. An imagination-disbeliever says *"I cannot trust that what you're suggesting is good/feasible/correct and therefore I will not allow it."* Disbelievers come in a lot of different flavors depending on what it is that's limiting their own imagination, whether it be convention (*this is how we've always done it*), social fears (*people will think this is weird*), or ego (*only ideas that I come up with are good*).
