I don't believe in magic, but the longer I spend on this planet in this meat sack of a body, the more I want to trust there's some level of organizing force present. I don't know what that force is, and I'm not too invested in trying to figure it out.

Tarot, though, is a cool and interesting [[framework]] for examining life, and it's something that I'd like to get better at understanding, investigating, and applying.
