### Where should I start?

Since things aren't chronological, you should start on anything you think is interesting! Obviously that's a pretty vague answer, but you can poke around this map and see what you like!

{% include notes_graph.html %}

If you're really looking for a recommendation, why don't you start on [[The Secret Bucket List]]

### Why doesn't the blog have a title or a theme?

I don't really have specific enough expertise or interests to always want to write about a single subject. So the only common thread across things is that I think they're neat and I'm writing about them.

### Are you taking feedback?

Kind of. I think editing posts would go against the goal of the blog, but I love collaboratively building out new discussions and thoughts! If you have strong feelings about something I've written (positive, negative, adjacent) I'd love to hear from you. I didn't choose a platform with the ability for comments because comment sections are toxic, but if you want to put your thoughts online beside mine, I'd be happy to give you a section in any of my posts! You can reach out to me at `charlie at trochlil dot com`.

### I found a dead link/an unfinished article/some other weird thing

Since this blog is a digital garden, it doesn't operate on a regular write/publish cycle; it gets edited, updated, and ideated on in real time. If you found an empty page, that's someplace I want to put a post but haven't gotten to yet. If it's a broken link, feel free to bring it to my attention and I'll try to fix it soon!

### How did you build this site?

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.app/).

The remarkable template I used to build this blog is by Maxime Vaillancourt, who you can find online [here](https://maximevaillancourt.com/).
